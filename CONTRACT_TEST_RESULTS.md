## 🏁 Conclusion

The **GameTrophyPlatform** contract successfully deploys and handles core NFT functionality. However, there are significant issues with user profile management and address mapping that need to be resolved before the contract is production-ready.

**The contract is 60% functional** - suitable for basic trophy minting but requires fixes for full user management capabilities.
